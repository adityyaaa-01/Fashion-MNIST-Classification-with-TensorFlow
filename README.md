# 🧠 Fashion MNIST Classification with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to build a simple neural network using TensorFlow to classify images from the **Fashion MNIST dataset**.

## 📂 Dataset
Fashion MNIST is a dataset of 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) across 10 different clothing categories:
- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

## 🚀 What I Did
- Loaded and normalized the dataset using `tensorflow.keras.datasets`
- Built a neural network with:
  - Input layer
  - Hidden layer (128 neurons, ReLU)
  - Output layer (10 neurons, Softmax)
- Trained the model on 60,000 images and tested it on 10,000 images
- Evaluated performance using accuracy and loss metrics
- Visualized predictions and model confidence

## 📊 Model Performance
The model achieved:
- **Training Accuracy:** ~91.65%
- **Test Accuracy:** ~88.47%
- **Loss on Test Data:** ~0.3322

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 📁 File
